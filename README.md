This my project for 3005 V2

ASSUMPTIONS :

1. The number of trainers , admin_staff and rooms  are all predetermined meaning they don't change.
2. The hours capable of working in a day  are limited to ( morning , afternoon, evening and night for trainers and no night for classes)
3. Billing is an impression of payment process and not an actual billing sytenm which takes in bank details.
4. The trainer and member require a room to carry out their private training sesisons.

Whenever testing please use the sample data provided in the DML ile in order fo ryou to have an easier time testing so you do not violate any additional constraints I may have had to set.
